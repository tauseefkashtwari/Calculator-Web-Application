URL: https://app-276-calculator.herokuapp.com/

○	Designed and created a web calculator application using Heroku to calculate averages (mean and weighted) based on grades.
○	Created input fields for inserting name, weightage, and score for each activity to allow data entry from users. 
○	Developed CSS stylesheets to ensure the page structure and visual elements match the user requirements.   
○	Implemented buttons in HTML to perform functions : add/delete rows and calculate mean and weighted averages.
○	Programmed additional features, such as a calculator reset and row addition or deletion, in  JavaScript to improve application usability and user-friendliness. 

**TO View the code**
 - Step 1: Unzip the FOLDER (app-276-calculator) first to extract the files into a directory once you SSH into the Github repository (or use git clone to download the files). 
 - Step 2: As I used the demo heroku project, kindly see the files located in the public folder (src > main > resources > public) and the HTML, JavaScript (calculator.js) and CSS file.
