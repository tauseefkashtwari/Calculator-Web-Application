# assn-1-app-276

Please unzip the FOLDER (app-276-calculator) first to extract the files into a directory once you SSH into the Github repository (or use git clone to download the files). I used the demo heroku project and replaced the files located in the public folder (src > main > resources > public) and have an html file, css file (in a subfolder called stylesheets) and a javascript file called calculator.js (these are all located within app-276-calculator folder - once you unzip it).
